# [mpv] Configs

[mpv] is a free and open source video player, which forked from mplayer2 and MPlayer.

[mpv] outputs high quality video with efficient algorithms. It's under active development now.

## Configs

Here are my [mpv] configuration files on OS X & Linux.

These configurations enable hardware decoding and a simple UI.

Some automation is added to [mpv].

- Automatically mark video file as finished by removing the `Unfinished` finder tag.
- Automatically add files with similar name in the same directory to play list.

## Install [mpv]

Follow the instruction in [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/)

## Use these configs

[mpv] will load files in `~/.config/mpv` as configurations automatically. Just put these files there.
